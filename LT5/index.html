                     <p>“505” was written by Alex Turner with production done by James Ford and Mike Crossey, and details a toxic relationship between Turner and a lover, and how Turner wishes to return to 505 – perhaps an ode to their hometown in Sheffield, where there is a bus route titled “505”.</p>

                     <p>Depression Cherry seems to explore the aftermath of a disintegrating relationship - where one soul is trying to connect back with the world. This soul invested so much in the relationship that has been severed. But was he lost to begin with? Was his only way of feeling at home in the world through this other soul? Hence, : "Were you ever lost? Was she ever found?" This character is floating in space. You can see it in his eyes - the Abyss he is in. And the only thing left for him to do is to let gravity take its course to pull him back into belonging the world - "Fall back into place."</p>

                     <p>When asked about the song in 1993, Yorke said, "I have a real problem being a man in the '90s… Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you're in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do… It comes back to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it's not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I'm always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it."</p>

                     <p>The idea of Mind Over Matter could be many different things, but for us it was a little mantra of trying to get past these certain obstacles that one makes three-dimensional, but which are actually a figment of our own imagination. The record was trying to objectively see that. It wasn’t trying to take a stance on it and say “all obstacles are bad,” or “all obstacles need to be surpassed.” </p>

                     <p>The boy in love becomes clumsy. Is "your" heart now looking toward me or other? This makes me curious and anxious. Love is not always sweet. Sometimes it brings about the feeling that is as bitter as coffee and painful as when an arrow hits the heart. The song will persuade listeners by Sam Kim's vocal through the lyrics that straightforwardly express the complex emotions of a boy when he falls in love.</p>
