                <h4>by: Maggie Bernard</h4> <br><br>
                <p>The lady who has loved you as you've grown
                    will always love and cherish you for all time.
                    She has the greatest heart ever known.<br><br>
                    She watched you grow through every milestone
                    and held you during every bedtime.
                    She is the lady who has loved you as you've grown. <br><br>
                    You happen to be her most precious stone,
                    and her love is as brilliant as a summer's day.
                    She has the greatest heart ever known. <br><br>
                    And if you ever feel alone,
                    she is the one to make you feel fine.
                    She has loved you as you've grown. <br><br>        
                    She will brag about you to anyone known,
                    because to her, you are perfectly sublime.
                    Her heart is the greatest ever known. <br><br>
                    I desire to be like her when I am grown
                    and have a daughter of my own,
                    because she has taught me how to love as I've grown. <br><br>
                    She has the greatest heart ever known.
